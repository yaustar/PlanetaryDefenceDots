# Learning about Unity DOTS 

I'm currently learning about Unity DOTS and looking at converting an existing game to the new system.

The game is from the Unity Asset Store, [Planetary Defence](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/planetary-defence-104099) by [Daniel Buckley](https://www.daniel-buckley.com/) with permission to share the assets from this work.

I will also be making notes and findings in my [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EFSFLf8bJTZq60kwLzHBOTnb9nv6_Oelu5ho6J_-uI/edit#heading=h.vnidl1turkaz) as I go along :)
